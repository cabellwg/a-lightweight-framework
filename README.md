# a-lightweight-framework
A lightweight web framework containing a few essential tools and a simple architecture for small projects.

I created this framework during high school for personal use, and I decided to release it in case anyone else thought they might want to use it. I've been kind to myself in calling it a framework â€“ it's really more of a template with a few SASS variables already written, but it has gotten me past that terrifying blank canvas more than once.

It was designed for the Atom text editor, with the package [`sass-autocompile`](https://atom.io/packages/sass-autocompile "sass-autocompile in Atom package library"). It includes the [Bourbon](https://www.bourbon.io/ "Bourbon homepage") toolkit for additional functionality.

See the wiki page for instructions on how to use this framework. If you do use it, shoot me an email to tell me how! I'd love to see what you come up with.
