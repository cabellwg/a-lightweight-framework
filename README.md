# a-lightweight-framework
A lightweight web framework containing a few essential tools and a scalable architecture.

I created this framework during high school for personal use, and I decided to release it in case anyone else thought they might want to use it. I've been kind to myself in calling it a framework â€“ it's really more of a template with a few SASS variables already written, but it has served me time after time.

It was designed for the Atom text editor, with the package [sass-autocompile](https://atom.io/packages/sass-autocompile "sass-autocompile in Atom package library"). It includes the [Bourbon](https://www.bourbon.io/ "Bourbon homepage") toolkit for additional functionality (why reinvent the wheel?).

See the wiki page for instructions on how to use it.
