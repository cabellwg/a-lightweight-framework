// The convention followed in this SASS structure is to place stylesheets for specific elements in the subdirectories and import them in the indexes for those directories.  The indexes for each subdirectory are then imported here, and this outputs to an automatically generated and minified (if you are using the sass-autocompile Atom plugin) CSS file that all HTML or PHP files should link to.  Only having one CSS file reduces the number of HTTP requests and speeds up the website.
